    <pre>For a 2-year-old child undergoing an MRI, both **chloral hydrate** and **propofol** have been used for sedation, but their use, recommendations, and dosing are guided by safety, efficacy, and institutional protocols.

### 1. **Chloral Hydrate**
- **Use:** Historically common for non-painful procedures like MRI in young children.
- **AAP/ASA Guidelines:** The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) have noted that chloral hydrate is effective but has a narrow safety margin, risk of prolonged sedation, and is no longer available in many countries (including the US).
- **Dose Range:** If used, the typical oral dose is **50–100 mg/kg** (maximum usually 1 g/dose), but the AAP cautions about its use due to safety concerns and lack of availability.
- **Current Status:** Many institutions have moved away from chloral hydrate due to these concerns.

### 2. **Propofol**
- **Use:** Widely used for deep sedation or general anesthesia in children for MRI, administered by anesthesia professionals.
- **AAP/ASA Guidelines:** Both organizations recommend that propofol should only be administered by individuals trained in airway management and advanced life support, as it can cause deep sedation and respiratory depression.
- **Dose Range:** 
  - **Initial bolus:** 1–2 mg/kg IV
  - **Maintenance infusion:** 100–200 mcg/kg/min IV (titrated to effect)
- **Note:** Propofol is not recommended for use by non-anesthesia personnel.

### 3. **Guideline Summary**
- **AAP (2019 Clinical Report: &#34;Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of Pediatric Patients During and After Sedation for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures&#34;)** and **ASA (Practice Guidelines for Sedation and Analgesia by Non-Anesthesiologists)**:
  - Do **not** recommend a specific sedative; choice depends on patient, procedure, and provider expertise.
  - Emphasize safety, monitoring, and provider training over specific drug choice.
  - Both highlight the risks of deep sedation and the need for appropriate personnel and monitoring.

### 4. **Practical Considerations**
- **Chloral hydrate**: Rarely used now; if used, 50–100 mg/kg orally, but with caution.
- **Propofol**: Preferred in many centers, but only by trained anesthesia providers; 1–2 mg/kg IV bolus, then infusion as needed.

---

**In summary:**  
- **Propofol** is generally preferred for MRI sedation in young children, but only by anesthesia-trained providers.
- **Chloral hydrate** is less favored due to safety and availability concerns.
- **AAP and ASA** do not provide a strict dose range in their guidelines but do provide general dosing in their references and stress the importance of provider training and monitoring.

**Always follow your institution’s protocols and consult with pediatric anesthesia for sedation in young children.**</pre>
