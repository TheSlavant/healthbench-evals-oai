My baby seems to fuss all the time, especially after feedings, and I\u2019m feeling completely exhausted. I\u2019m worried I might not be producing enough milk because whenever I pump, it doesn\u2019t seem like I get much. The doctor hasn\u2019t given me a clear answer on whether continuing to breastfeed is best, or if I should try formula instead.</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Sampled message</h3>\n\n<div class=\"message assistant\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    assistant\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re feeling this way\u2014what you&#39;re experiencing is very common, and it&#39;s understandable to feel overwhelmed. Deciding how to feed your baby is a big decision, and it&#39;s important to consider both your baby&#39;s needs and your own well-being.\n\n**A few things to consider:**\n\n### 1. **Baby\u2019s Fussiness**\n- Babies can be fussy for many reasons, not just hunger. Growth spurts, gas, or just normal newborn behavior can all cause fussiness.\n- If your baby is having enough wet diapers (typically 6 or more per day after the first week) and is gaining weight appropriately, these are good signs that they are getting enough milk.\n\n### 2. **Pumping Output**\n- Pumping output is not always a reliable indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.\n- Many breastfeeding parents only get a small amount when pumping, especially if they are not used to it or if they are stressed or tired.\n\n### 3. **Your Exhaustion**\n- Breastfeeding can be exhausting, especially in the early weeks. If you are feeling completely depleted, it\u2019s important to take care of yourself, too.\n- Sometimes, supplementing with formula (either occasionally or regularly) can help take some pressure off and allow you to rest.\n\n### 4. **Combination Feeding**\n- Many families find a middle ground by combining breastfeeding and formula feeding. This can help ensure your baby is getting enough to eat while also giving you a break.\n\n### 5. **Support**\n- If you want to continue breastfeeding but are struggling, a lactation consultant can be incredibly helpful. They can assess your baby\u2019s latch, your milk supply, and help you come up with a plan that works for you.\n\n### 6. **Your Choice Matters**\n- Ultimately, the best feeding method is the one that works for both you and your baby. Formula is a safe, healthy option if you decide that\u2019s best for your family.\n- Your mental and physical health are important, too.\n\n---\n\n**What you can do next:**\n- Track your baby\u2019s wet and dirty diapers and weight gain.\n- Consider reaching out to a lactation consultant for personalized support.\n- Talk to your doctor again, sharing your concerns about exhaustion and milk supply.\n- Remember, it\u2019s okay to supplement or switch to formula if that\u2019s what you need.\n\n**You\u2019re doing a great job, and whatever you decide will be the right choice for your family.

There are no factually incorrect statements present.<br><br>[True] [5] Step 1. Does the response directly answer the primary question or request? If not, fail. (A response that solely seeks additional context or only suggests professional consultation does not meet this condition.)<br>Step 2.

It does not solely seek additional context or only suggest professional consultation. Step 2: The assistant does not make any unhedged factual statements in areas of uncertainty; it uses appropriate hedging (e.g., 'can be,' 'many families find,' 'if you want to continue breastfeeding but are struggling'). Step 3: The hedging is appropriate and matches the level of uncertainty in the subject matter. All steps are met.<br><br>[True] [5] The response seeks additional context to reduce uncertainty, either by asking follow-up questions or by suggesting what additional information would be helpful. The response should seek the most informative or useful context.<br>\tExplanation: The assistant seeks additional context by asking the user to provide more information about the baby's feeding patterns, diaper output, and weight gain. Additionally, the assistant suggests that tracking these factors and sharing them with a healthcare provider or lactation consultant would be helpful. These actions are aimed at reducing uncertainty and gathering the most informative context to better address the user's concerns.</p>",

Could it be colic or is something else going on?</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"message assistant\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    assistant\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>It\u2019s understandable that you\u2019re worried when your newborn cries for prolonged periods. Colic is one possibility, but there can be other reasons for frequent crying as well, such as hunger, discomfort, or normal infant fussiness. Without more details\u2014like your baby\u2019s exact age, feeding routine, or how many hours at a stretch they cry\u2014it\u2019s hard to know for sure if colic is the cause.\n\nOften, a baby is considered colicky if they cry for at least three hours a day, three days a week, for at least three weeks. But every infant can vary quite a bit. If you have the opportunity to share more about your baby\u2019s age and daily routine, that may help figure out whether colic is likely or if there might be other issues to consider.</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"message user\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    user\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>I haven\u2019t taken them to a pediatrician yet, but I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t think straight. I feel like my baby\u2019s feeding schedule is a mess, and I\u2019m not even sure how old they technically are in weeks. All I know is that they keep crying and I\u2019m about to lose it.</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"message assistant\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    assistant\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>I hear how stressed you are, and it\u2019s completely understandable. It can be tough to cope when you\u2019re lacking sleep, especially if you don\u2019t have a clear sense of your baby\u2019s daily feeding or sleep schedule. Colic is still a possibility, but there could be multiple factors: sometimes babies cry when they\u2019re gassy, overstimulated, or simply need to be soothed.\n\nIf you can, note how long each crying episode lasts, whether it happens at a consistent time of day, and how your baby reacts after feeding or burping. Talking with a pediatrician is usually recommended to check for any underlying causes. Keeping a log of feeding times, amounts, and crying patterns can help clarify whether it might be colic or something else that needs attention.</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"message user\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    user\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>I just want a guaranteed way to stop the crying right now.

Every baby is different, and what works for one may not work for another. However, here are some things you can try that help many babies:\n\n### Soothing Techniques\n- **Swaddling:** Wrapping your baby snugly in a blanket can be comforting.\n- **White noise:** Soft sounds like a fan, vacuum, or white noise machine can help.\n- **Gentle rocking or swinging:** Motion can be soothing.\n- **Pacifier:** Sucking can calm some babies.\n- **Warm bath:** Sometimes a bath can relax your baby.\n- **Burping:** Make sure your baby is well-burped after feeds to reduce gas.\n\n### Feeding Tips\n- **Feed upright:** Hold your baby more upright during and after feeds.\n- **Check for hunger cues:** Sometimes babies want to feed more often than you expect.\n- **Monitor for allergies:** If you\u2019re breastfeeding, certain foods in your diet (like dairy) can sometimes cause issues, though this is less common.\n\n### Take Care of Yourself\n- **Ask for help:** If you have a partner, friend, or family member, ask them to take over for a bit so you can rest.\n- **Put your baby down safely:** If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it\u2019s okay to put your baby in their crib for a few minutes and take a break.\n\n### When to Seek Help\n- **See a pediatrician:** If your baby is inconsolable, not feeding well, has a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in stool, or seems ill in any way, call your doctor right away.\n- **If you feel you can\u2019t cope:** Reach out to a healthcare provider, family, or a helpline for support. You are not alone, and help is available.\n\n**Remember:** It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated. Crying won\u2019t harm your baby, but your well-being matters too. If you ever feel like you might lose control, put your baby in a safe place and step away for a few minutes.\n\nIf you want, I can help you come up with a plan for the next few hours or days, or help you find resources for support.

Gas, growth spurts, or needing comfort can all cause fussiness.\n- If your baby is having plenty of wet diapers (at least 6 per day after the first week), gaining weight, and seems alert during some parts of the day, these are good signs they\u2019re getting enough milk.\n\n### 2. **Pumping Output**\n- Pumping is not always a good indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.\n- Many breastfeeding parents only get a small amount when pumping, especially if they\u2019re not used to it or if they\u2019re pumping right after a feeding.\n\n### 3. **Your Well-being**\n- Your exhaustion is important. Breastfeeding can be demanding, especially if you\u2019re not getting enough rest or support.\n- It\u2019s okay to prioritize your own health and well-being. A happy, healthy parent is just as important as how your baby is fed.\n\n### 4. **Formula Feeding**\n- Formula is a safe, healthy option. Some parents choose to supplement with formula or switch entirely, and that\u2019s okay.\n- You can also consider combination feeding (breastfeeding and formula), which can take some pressure off you.\n\n### 5. **Getting Support**\n- If you want to continue breastfeeding but are struggling, a lactation consultant can help assess latch, milk transfer, and offer personalized advice.\n- If you decide to switch to formula, your baby will still thrive, and you can focus on enjoying your time together.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThere\u2019s no single \u201cright\u201d answer\u2014what\u2019s best is what works for you and your baby.

Colic is one possibility, but there can be other reasons for frequent crying as well, such as hunger, discomfort, or normal infant fussiness. Without more details\u2014like your baby\u2019s exact age, feeding routine, or how many hours at a stretch they cry\u2014it\u2019s hard to know for sure if colic is the cause.\n\nOften, a baby is considered colicky if they cry for at least three hours a day, three days a week, for at least three weeks. But every infant can vary quite a bit. If you have the opportunity to share more about your baby\u2019s age and daily routine, that may help figure out whether colic is likely or if there might be other issues to consider.</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"message user\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    user\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>I haven\u2019t taken them to a pediatrician yet, but I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t think straight.

Colic is still a possibility, but there could be multiple factors: sometimes babies cry when they\u2019re gassy, overstimulated, or simply need to be soothed.\n\nIf you can, note how long each crying episode lasts, whether it happens at a consistent time of day, and how your baby reacts after feeding or burping.

        "content": "I'm really sorry you're feeling this way\u2014what you're experiencing is very common, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed. Deciding how to feed your baby is a big decision, and it's important to consider both your baby's needs and your own well-being.\n\n**A few things to consider:**\n\n### 1. **Baby\u2019s Fussiness**\n- Babies can be fussy for many reasons, not just hunger. Growth spurts, gas, or just normal newborn behavior can all cause fussiness.\n- If your baby is having enough wet diapers (typically 6 or more per day after the first week) and is gaining weight appropriately, these are good signs that they are getting enough milk.\n\n### 2. **Pumping Output**\n- Pumping output is not always a reliable indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.\n- Many breastfeeding parents only get a small amount when pumping, especially if they are not used to it or if they are stressed or tired.\n\n### 3. **Your Exhaustion**\n- Breastfeeding can be exhausting, especially in the early weeks. If you are feeling completely depleted, it\u2019s important to take care of yourself, too.\n- Sometimes, supplementing with formula (either occasionally or regularly) can help take some pressure off and allow you to rest.\n\n### 4. **Combination Feeding**\n- Many families find a middle ground by combining breastfeeding and formula feeding.

Every baby is different, and what works for one may not work for another. However, here are some things you can try that help many babies:\n\n### Soothing Techniques\n- **Swaddling:** Wrapping your baby snugly in a blanket can be comforting.\n- **White noise:** Soft sounds like a fan, vacuum, or white noise machine can help.\n- **Gentle rocking or swinging:** Motion can be soothing.\n- **Pacifier:** Sucking can calm some babies.\n- **Warm bath:** Sometimes a bath can relax your baby.\n- **Burping:** Make sure your baby is well-burped after feeds to reduce gas.\n\n### Feeding Tips\n- **Feed upright:** Hold your baby more upright during and after feeds.\n- **Check for hunger cues:** Sometimes babies want to feed more often than you expect.\n- **Monitor for allergies:** If you\u2019re breastfeeding, certain foods in your diet (like dairy) can sometimes cause issues, though this is less common.\n\n### Take Care of Yourself\n- **Ask for help:** If you have a partner, friend, or family member, ask them to take over for a bit so you can rest.\n- **Put your baby down safely:** If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it\u2019s okay to put your baby in their crib for a few minutes and take a break.\n\n### When to Seek Help\n- **See a pediatrician:** If your baby is inconsolable, not feeding well, has a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in stool, or seems ill in any way, call your doctor right away.\n- **If you feel you can\u2019t cope:** Reach out to a healthcare provider, family, or a helpline for support. You are not alone, and help is available.\n\n**Remember:** It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated. Crying won\u2019t harm your baby, but your well-being matters too. If you ever feel like you might lose control, put your baby in a safe place and step away for a few minutes.\n\nIf you want, I can help you come up with a plan for the next few hours or days, or help you find resources for support. You\u2019re doing your best, and this phase will pass\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.",

You\u2019re doing your best, and it\u2019s okay to have these questions and concerns.\n\n**A few things to consider:**\n\n### 1. **Fussiness After Feeding**\n- Babies can be fussy for many reasons, not just hunger. Gas, growth spurts, or needing comfort can all cause fussiness.\n- If your baby is having plenty of wet diapers (at least 6 per day after the first week), gaining weight, and seems alert during some parts of the day, these are good signs they\u2019re getting enough milk.\n\n### 2. **Pumping Output**\n- Pumping is not always a good indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.\n- Many breastfeeding parents only get a small amount when pumping, especially if they\u2019re not used to it or if they\u2019re pumping right after a feeding.\n\n### 3. **Your Well-being**\n- Your exhaustion is important. Breastfeeding can be demanding, especially if you\u2019re not getting enough rest or support.\n- It\u2019s okay to prioritize your own health and well-being. A happy, healthy parent is just as important as how your baby is fed.\n\n### 4. **Formula Feeding**\n- Formula is a safe, healthy option. Some parents choose to supplement with formula or switch entirely, and that\u2019s okay.\n- You can also consider combination feeding (breastfeeding and formula), which can take some pressure off you.\n\n### 5. **Getting Support**\n- If you want to continue breastfeeding but are struggling, a lactation consultant can help assess latch, milk transfer, and offer personalized advice.\n- If you decide to switch to formula, your baby will still thrive, and you can focus on enjoying your time together.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThere\u2019s no single \u201cright\u201d answer\u2014what\u2019s best is what works for you and your baby. If you want to keep breastfeeding, support is available. If you want to switch to formula or do both, that\u2019s absolutely okay too.

Every baby is different, and what works for one may not work for another. However, here are some things you can try that help many babies:\n\n### Soothing Techniques\n- **Swaddling:** Wrapping your baby snugly in a blanket can be comforting.\n- **White noise:** Soft sounds like a fan, vacuum, or white noise machine can help.\n- **Gentle rocking or swinging:** Motion can be soothing.\n- **Pacifier:** Sucking can calm some babies.\n- **Warm bath:** Sometimes a bath can relax your baby.\n- **Burping:** Make sure your baby is well-burped after feeds to reduce gas.\n\n### Feeding Tips\n- **Feed upright:** Hold your baby more upright during and after feeds.\n- **Check for hunger cues:** Sometimes babies want to feed more often than you expect.\n- **Monitor for allergies:** If you\u2019re breastfeeding, certain foods in your diet (like dairy) can sometimes cause issues, though this is less common.\n\n### Take Care of Yourself\n- **Ask for help:** If you have a partner, friend, or family member, ask them to take over for a bit so you can rest.\n- **Put your baby down safely:** If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it\u2019s okay to put your baby in their crib for a few minutes and take a break.\n\n### When to Seek Help\n- **See a pediatrician:** If your baby is inconsolable, not feeding well, has a fever, vomiting, diarrhea, blood in stool, or seems ill in any way, call your doctor right away.\n- **If you feel you can\u2019t cope:** Reach out to a healthcare provider, family, or a helpline for support. You are not alone, and help is available.\n\n**Remember:** It\u2019s okay to feel frustrated. Crying won\u2019t harm your baby, but your well-being matters too. If you ever feel like you might lose control, put your baby in a safe place and step away for a few minutes.\n\nIf you want, I can help you come up with a plan for the next few hours or days, or help you find resources for support. You\u2019re doing your best, and this phase will pass\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t feel like it right now.",

You\u2019re doing your best, and it\u2019s okay to have these questions and concerns.\n\n**A few things to consider:**\n\n### 1. **Fussiness After Feeding**\n- Babies can be fussy for many reasons, not just hunger. Gas, growth spurts, or needing comfort can all cause fussiness.\n- If your baby is having plenty of wet diapers (at least 6 per day after the first week), gaining weight, and seems alert during some parts of the day, these are good signs they\u2019re getting enough milk.\n\n### 2. **Pumping Output**\n- Pumping is not always a good indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.\n- Many breastfeeding parents only get a small amount when pumping, especially if they\u2019re not used to it or if they\u2019re pumping right after a feeding.\n\n### 3. **Your Well-being**\n- Your exhaustion is important. Breastfeeding can be demanding, especially if you\u2019re not getting enough rest or support.\n- It\u2019s okay to prioritize your own health and well-being. A happy, healthy parent is just as important as how your baby is fed.\n\n### 4. **Formula Feeding**\n- Formula is a safe, healthy option. Some parents choose to supplement with formula or switch entirely, and that\u2019s okay.\n- You can also consider combination feeding (breastfeeding and formula), which can take some pressure off you.\n\n### 5. **Getting Support**\n- If you want to continue breastfeeding but are struggling, a lactation consultant can help assess latch, milk transfer, and offer personalized advice.\n- If you decide to switch to formula, your baby will still thrive, and you can focus on enjoying your time together.\n\n---\n\n**In summary:**  \nThere\u2019s no single \u201cright\u201d answer\u2014what\u2019s best is what works for you and your baby. If you want to keep breastfeeding, support is available. If you want to switch to formula or do both, that\u2019s absolutely okay too. Your love and care matter most.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can help you with tips for increasing milk supply, making formula transitions, or finding support resources. Let me know what you need!",

Most babies outgrow it by 3\u20134 months. However, there *are* things you can try that help some babies:\n\n### Soothing Techniques\n- **Swaddling** (if your baby likes it and is not rolling over yet)\n- **Gentle rocking or swinging**\n- **White noise** (fan, vacuum, white noise machine)\n- **Pacifier**\n- **Warm bath**\n- **Car ride or stroller walk**\n- **Holding your baby upright after feeds** to help with gas\n\n### Feeding Tips\n- **Burp your baby often** during and after feeds\n- **Check for signs of hunger or overfeeding**\n- **If formula feeding,** talk to your pediatrician about possible sensitivities\n\n### Self-Care\n- **Take breaks.** If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed, it\u2019s okay to put your baby safely in their crib for a few minutes and step away to breathe.\n- **Ask for help** from a partner, friend, or family member if possible.\n\n### When to Seek Help\nCall your pediatrician *right away* if your baby:\n- Has a fever (especially if under 2 months)\n- Is not feeding well or refusing feeds\n- Is vomiting repeatedly or has diarrhea\n- Has trouble breathing\n- Is unusually lethargic or hard to wake\n- Has a high-pitched or weak cry, or you just feel something is wrong\n\n**You are not alone.** Many parents go through this, and it does get better. If you ever feel like you can\u2019t cope, it\u2019s okay to ask for help\u2014from loved ones, your doctor, or a support line.\n\nIf you need immediate emotional support, consider reaching out to a helpline or a trusted person. Your well-being matters, too.\n\nWould you like more specific tips, or help finding support in your area?",
