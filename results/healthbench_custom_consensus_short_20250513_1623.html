    <pre>For a 2-year-old child undergoing an MRI, both **chloral hydrate** and **propofol** have been used for sedation, but their use, recommendations, and dosing are guided by safety, efficacy, and institutional protocols.

### 1. **Chloral Hydrate**
- **Use:** Traditionally used for sedation in young children for non-painful procedures like MRI.
- **AAP/ASA Guidelines:** The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) recognize chloral hydrate as an option, but its use has declined due to concerns about safety (especially respiratory depression), prolonged sedation, and availability (it is no longer available in some countries, including the US).
- **Dose Range:**  
  - **AAP (2016):** 25–100 mg/kg orally (maximum single dose 2 g).
  - **Common practice:** 50–75 mg/kg orally, not to exceed 1 g per dose.
- **Notes:** Requires monitoring for respiratory depression and prolonged sedation. Not recommended for children with obstructive sleep apnea or significant comorbidities.

### 2. **Propofol**
- **Use:** Widely used for deep sedation or general anesthesia for MRI in children, administered by anesthesia professionals.
- **AAP/ASA Guidelines:** Both organizations state that propofol should only be administered by individuals trained in airway management and advanced life support, as it can cause rapid deep sedation and apnea.
- **Dose Range:**  
  - **Induction:** 1–2 mg/kg IV bolus.
  - **Maintenance:** 100–200 mcg/kg/min IV infusion (titrated to effect).
- **Notes:** Requires IV access, continuous monitoring, and airway management skills.

### 3. **Guideline Summary**
- **AAP (2016) &#34;Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of Pediatric Patients During and After Sedation for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures&#34;:**
  - No specific preference for chloral hydrate vs. propofol; choice depends on patient, procedure, and provider expertise.
  - Emphasizes safety, monitoring, and provider training.
- **ASA (2018) &#34;Practice Guidelines for Moderate Procedural Sedation and Analgesia&#34;:**
  - Recommends that deep sedation (e.g., with propofol) be administered by qualified professionals.
  - Dosing is not specified in detail; refers to standard pharmacologic references.

### 4. **Current Practice**
- **Chloral hydrate** is less commonly used due to safety and availability concerns.
- **Propofol** is preferred in many centers for MRI sedation in young children, but only when administered by anesthesia-trained personnel.

---

**In summary:**  
- **Chloral hydrate**: 25–100 mg/kg PO (max 2 g), but less favored due to safety/availability.
- **Propofol**: 1–2 mg/kg IV bolus, then 100–200 mcg/kg/min infusion, administered by anesthesia professionals.
- **AAP/ASA**: Emphasize safety, monitoring, and provider training over specific drug choice.

**Always follow your institution’s protocols and consult with pediatric anesthesia or sedation services.**
