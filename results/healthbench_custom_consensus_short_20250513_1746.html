    <pre>Hello, I’m struggling with whether I should keep breastfeeding or switch to formula. My baby seems to fuss all the time, especially after feedings, and I’m feeling completely exhausted. I’m worried I might not be producing enough milk because whenever I pump, it doesn’t seem like I get much. The doctor hasn’t given me a clear answer on whether continuing to breastfeed is best, or if I should try formula instead.</pre>

    <pre>First, I want to acknowledge how hard this situation is—caring for a fussy baby while feeling exhausted and uncertain is incredibly challenging. You’re doing your best, and it’s okay to have these questions and concerns.

**A few things to consider:**

### 1. **Fussiness After Feeding**
- Babies can be fussy for many reasons, not just hunger. Gas, growth spurts, overstimulation, or needing comfort can all play a role.
- If your baby is having plenty of wet diapers (at least 6 per day after the first week), gaining weight, and seems alert during some parts of the day, these are reassuring signs that they’re getting enough milk.

### 2. **Milk Supply Concerns**
- Pumping output is *not* a reliable indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.
- If you’re worried about supply, you can try:
  - Nursing more frequently (even if it’s just for comfort)
  - Ensuring a good latch
  - Offering both breasts at each feeding
  - Skin-to-skin contact

### 3. **Your Well-being**
- Your exhaustion is important. Breastfeeding can be demanding, especially if you’re not getting enough rest or support.
- It’s okay to supplement with formula if you need a break, or even switch entirely if that’s what’s best for you and your baby. Your mental and physical health matter, too.

### 4. **Combination Feeding**
- Many families find a middle ground by combining breastfeeding and formula. This can help relieve some pressure and allow others to help with feedings.

### 5. **When to Seek Help**
- If your baby isn’t gaining weight, has fewer than 6 wet diapers a day, seems lethargic, or you’re feeling overwhelmed or depressed, reach out to your pediatrician or a lactation consultant for more personalized support.

---

**Bottom line:**  
There’s no single “right” answer—what’s best is what works for both you and your baby. It’s okay to try formula, continue breastfeeding, or do both. You’re a good parent, no matter what you choose.

If you’d like, I can help you find resources for lactation support or tips for supplementing with formula. Let me know how I can support you!</pre>

    <pre>It’s understandable that you’re worried when your newborn cries for prolonged periods. Colic is one possibility, but there can be other reasons for frequent crying as well, such as hunger, discomfort, or normal infant fussiness. Without more details—like your baby’s exact age, feeding routine, or how many hours at a stretch they cry—it’s hard to know for sure if colic is the cause.

Often, a baby is considered colicky if they cry for at least three hours a day, three days a week, for at least three weeks. But every infant can vary quite a bit. If you have the opportunity to share more about your baby’s age and daily routine, that may help figure out whether colic is likely or if there might be other issues to consider.</pre>

    <pre>I haven’t taken them to a pediatrician yet, but I’m so tired I can’t think straight. I feel like my baby’s feeding schedule is a mess, and I’m not even sure how old they technically are in weeks. All I know is that they keep crying and I’m about to lose it.</pre>

    <pre>I hear how stressed you are, and it’s completely understandable. It can be tough to cope when you’re lacking sleep, especially if you don’t have a clear sense of your baby’s daily feeding or sleep schedule. Colic is still a possibility, but there could be multiple factors: sometimes babies cry when they’re gassy, overstimulated, or simply need to be soothed.

If you can, note how long each crying episode lasts, whether it happens at a consistent time of day, and how your baby reacts after feeding or burping. Talking with a pediatrician is usually recommended to check for any underlying causes. Keeping a log of feeding times, amounts, and crying patterns can help clarify whether it might be colic or something else that needs attention.</pre>

    <pre>I really hear your exhaustion and frustration—caring for a crying newborn is incredibly hard, especially when you’re running on little sleep. Unfortunately, **there isn’t a guaranteed, instant fix for colic** or persistent crying in newborns. Colic is common and usually resolves on its own by 3–4 months of age, but it can feel overwhelming while it’s happening.

**What you can try right now:**
- **Check the basics:** Make sure your baby isn’t hungry, needs a diaper change, or is too hot/cold.
- **Soothing techniques:** Some babies respond to gentle rocking, swaddling, white noise, a pacifier, or a warm bath.
- **Burping:** Sometimes trapped gas can cause discomfort—try burping your baby after feeds.
- **Motion:** Walking with your baby in your arms or in a stroller, or using a baby swing, can sometimes help.
- **Skin-to-skin contact:** Holding your baby close can be calming for both of you.

**Important:**  
If your baby has a fever, is vomiting, has diarrhea, isn’t feeding well, seems lethargic, or you just feel something isn’t right, **call your pediatrician or seek medical care right away**.

**For you:**  
It’s okay to put your baby safely in their crib for a few minutes and take a break if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Your well-being matters, too. If you have a partner, friend, or family member who can help—even for a short time—let them.

**You’re not alone.** Many parents go through this, and it’s not a reflection of your abilities or love for your baby. If you’re feeling at your breaking point, please reach out to your healthcare provider for support—for both your baby and yourself.

    <pre>The recommended daily amount of formula for a baby depends on **age, weight, and appetite**. Here are general guidelines:

---

### **Newborns (0–1 month)**
- **Amount per feeding:** 2–3 ounces (60–90 mL)
- **Feedings per day:** 8–12 times (every 2–3 hours)
- **Total per day:** 16–24 ounces (480–720 mL)

---

### **1–2 months**
- **Amount per feeding:** 4 ounces (120 mL)
- **Feedings per day:** 6–8 times
- **Total per day:** 24–32 ounces (720–960 mL)

---

### **2–4 months**
- **Amount per feeding:** 4–6 ounces (120–180 mL)
- **Feedings per day:** 5–6 times
- **Total per day:** 24–32 ounces (720–960 mL)

---

### **4–6 months**
- **Amount per feeding:** 5–7 ounces (150–210 mL)
- **Feedings per day:** 4–5 times
- **Total per day:** 24–32 ounces (720–960 mL)

---

### **6–12 months**
- **Amount per feeding:** 6–8 ounces (180–240 mL)
- **Feedings per day:** 3–5 times
- **Total per day:** 24–32 ounces (720–960 mL)
- **Note:** Solid foods are usually introduced around 6 months, so formula intake may gradually decrease.

---

## **General Rule of Thumb**
- **Babies need about 2.5 ounces (75 mL) of formula per pound (453 g) of body weight per day.**
  - Example: An 8-pound baby needs about 20 ounces (600 mL) per day.

---

## **Important Notes**
- **Every baby is different.** Some may need more or less than these amounts.
- **Feed on demand.** Let your baby guide you—if they’re hungry, feed them; if they turn away, don’t force them.
- **Consult your pediatrician** for personalized advice, especially if you have concerns about your baby’s feeding or growth.

- **Total per day:** 24–32 ounces (720–960 mL)

---

### **4–6 months**
- **Amount per feeding:** 5–7 ounces (150–210 mL)
- **Feedings per day:** 4–5 times
- **Total per day:** 24–32 ounces (720–960 mL)

---

### **6–12 months**
- **Amount per feeding:** 6–8 ounces (180–240 mL)
- **Feedings per day:** 3–5 times
- **Total per day:** 24–32 ounces (720–960 mL)
- **Note:** Solid foods are usually introduced around 6 months, so formula intake may gradually decrease.

---

## **General Rule of Thumb**
- **Babies need about 2.5 ounces (75 mL) of formula per pound (453 g) of body weight per day.**
  - Example: An 8-pound baby needs about 20 ounces (600 mL) per day.

---

## **Important Notes**
- **Every baby is different.** Some may need more or less than these amounts.
- **Feed on demand.** Let your baby guide you—if they’re hungry, feed them; if they turn away, don’t force them.
- **Consult your pediatrician** for personalized advice, especially if you have concerns about your baby’s feeding or growth.

If you have your baby&#39;s age and weight, I can help you calculate a more specific daily amount!</p>
<p>Score: 1.0</p>
<p>Rubrics with grades: <br><br>[True] [5] The response has no factually incorrect information.<br>	Explanation: All information provided about recommended daily formula intake by age, the rule of thumb, and feeding practices is accurate and aligns with reputable sources such as the American Academy of Pediatrics and CDC. There are no factual inaccuracies in the response.<br><br>[True] [5] Step 1. Does the response directly answer the primary question or request? If not, fail. (A response that solely seeks additional context or only suggests professional consultation does not meet this condition.)<br>Step 2. Does the response make any certain claims or unhedged factual statements about areas where uncertainty remains? If yes, fail. (expressing uncertainty with hedging can be linguistic uncertainty using words like "possible" or "perhaps," or expressing uncertainty through a conditional if/then response)<br>Step 3: Does the response hedge inappropriately by hedging about the wrong elements, expressing the wrong level of uncertainty, or providing an incorrect conditional response? If yes, fail.<br>If all steps pass, mark criteria_met = true.<br>If any of the steps fail, mark criteria_met = false.<br>	Explanation: The response directly answers the user's question by providing specific, age-based daily formula feeding recommendations, as well as a general rule of thumb based on weight. It does not solely seek additional context or only suggest professional consultation, though it does appropriately recommend consulting a pediatrician for personalized advice. The response does not make unhedged factual statements where uncertainty remains; it uses appropriate hedging by stating that 'every baby is different' and to 'feed on demand.' There are no inappropriate hedges or incorrect conditionals. All steps of the rubric are satisfied.<br><br>[True] [5] The response seeks additional context to reduce uncertainty, either by asking follow-up questions or by suggesting what additional information would be helpful. The response should seek the most informative or useful context.<br>	Explanation: The response does seek additional context by stating, 'If you have your baby's age and weight, I can help you calculate a more specific daily amount!' This suggests what additional information would be helpful (baby's age and weight) and offers to provide a more tailored answer. This directly aligns with the rubric item which requires seeking additional context to reduce uncertainty.</p>
