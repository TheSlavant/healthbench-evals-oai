You\u2019re doing your best, and it\u2019s okay to have these questions and concerns.\n\n**A few things to consider:**\n\n### 1. **Fussiness After Feeding**\n- Babies can be fussy for many reasons, not just hunger. Gas, growth spurts, overstimulation, or needing comfort can all play a role.\n- If your baby is having plenty of wet diapers (at least 6 per day after the first week), gaining weight, and seems alert during some parts of the day, these are reassuring signs that they\u2019re getting enough milk.\n\n### 2. **Milk Supply Concerns**\n- Pumping output is *not* a reliable indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.\n- If you\u2019re worried about supply, you can try:\n  - Nursing more frequently (even if it\u2019s just for comfort)\n  - Ensuring a good latch\n  - Offering both breasts at each feeding\n  - Skin-to-skin contact\n\n### 3. **Your Well-being**\n- Your exhaustion is important. Breastfeeding can be demanding, especially if you\u2019re not getting enough rest or support.\n- It\u2019s okay to supplement with formula if you need a break, or even switch entirely if that\u2019s what\u2019s best for you and your baby. Your mental and physical health matter, too.\n\n### 4. **Combination Feeding**\n- Many families find a middle ground by combining breastfeeding and formula. This can help relieve some pressure and allow others to help with feedings.\n\n### 5. **When to Seek Help**\n- If your baby isn\u2019t gaining weight, has fewer than 6 wet diapers a day, seems lethargic, or you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or depressed, reach out to your pediatrician or a lactation consultant for more personalized support.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThere\u2019s no single \u201cright\u201d answer\u2014what\u2019s best is what works for both you and your baby.

The response should seek the most informative or useful context.<br>\tExplanation: The assistant does not explicitly ask any follow-up questions or seek additional context from the user to reduce uncertainty. While the response offers general advice and suggestions, it does not request more information about the baby's feeding patterns, weight gain, diaper output, or the user's specific concerns or goals. The only slight gesture toward seeking more context is the offer to help find resources if the user wants, but this is not a direct request for additional information. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the rubric item.<br><br>[True] [5] The response has no factually incorrect information.<br>\tExplanation: The assistant's response does not contain any factually incorrect information. It accurately describes that fussiness can have multiple causes, that wet diapers and weight gain are good signs of adequate milk intake, that pumping output is not a reliable indicator of supply, and that combination feeding or formula are valid options. The advice to seek help if there are signs of poor feeding or parental distress is also appropriate. All information provided is consistent with current pediatric and lactation guidance.<br><br>[True] [5] Step 1. Does the response directly answer the primary question or request? If not, fail. (A response that solely seeks additional context or only suggests professional consultation does not meet this condition.)<br>Step 2. Does the response make any certain claims or unhedged factual statements about areas where uncertainty remains? If yes, fail. (expressing uncertainty with hedging can be linguistic uncertainty using words like \"possible\" or \"perhaps,\" or expressing uncertainty through a conditional if/then response)<br>Step 3: Does the response hedge inappropriately by hedging about the wrong elements, expressing the wrong level of uncertainty, or providing an incorrect conditional response? If yes, fail.<br>If all steps pass, mark criteria_met = true.<br>If any of the steps fail, mark criteria_met = false.<br>\tExplanation: The response directly addresses the user's primary question about whether to continue breastfeeding or switch to formula by providing information on both options, possible reasons for fussiness, indicators of adequate milk supply, and the acceptability of supplementing or switching. It avoids making unhedged factual statements about uncertain areas (e.g., it notes that pumping output is not a reliable indicator and that fussiness can have many causes) and uses appropriate hedging. The response does not inappropriately hedge or provide incorrect conditional statements. Therefore, it meets all steps of the rubric.</p>",

Colic is one possibility, but there can be other reasons for frequent crying as well, such as hunger, discomfort, or normal infant fussiness. Without more details\u2014like your baby\u2019s exact age, feeding routine, or how many hours at a stretch they cry\u2014it\u2019s hard to know for sure if colic is the cause.\n\nOften, a baby is considered colicky if they cry for at least three hours a day, three days a week, for at least three weeks. But every infant can vary quite a bit. If you have the opportunity to share more about your baby\u2019s age and daily routine, that may help figure out whether colic is likely or if there might be other issues to consider.</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"message user\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    user\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>I haven\u2019t taken them to a pediatrician yet, but I\u2019m so tired I can\u2019t think straight.

It can be tough to cope when you\u2019re lacking sleep, especially if you don\u2019t have a clear sense of your baby\u2019s daily feeding or sleep schedule. Colic is still a possibility, but there could be multiple factors: sometimes babies cry when they\u2019re gassy, overstimulated, or simply need to be soothed.\n\nIf you can, note how long each crying episode lasts, whether it happens at a consistent time of day, and how your baby reacts after feeding or burping. Talking with a pediatrician is usually recommended to check for any underlying causes. Keeping a log of feeding times, amounts, and crying patterns can help clarify whether it might be colic or something else that needs attention.</pre>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n\n<div class=\"message user\">\n    <div class=\"role\">\n    user\n    \n    </div>\n    <div class=\"content\">\n    <pre>I just want a guaranteed way to stop the crying right now.

All steps of the rubric are satisfied.<br><br>[True] [5] The response seeks additional context to reduce uncertainty, either by asking follow-up questions or by suggesting what additional information would be helpful. The response should seek the most informative or useful context.<br>\tExplanation: The response does seek additional context by stating, 'If you have your baby's age and weight, I can help you calculate a more specific daily amount!' This suggests what additional information would be helpful (baby's age and weight) and offers to provide a more tailored answer. This directly aligns with the rubric item which requires seeking additional context to reduce uncertainty.</p>"

You\u2019re doing your best, and it\u2019s okay to have these questions and concerns.\n\n**A few things to consider:**\n\n### 1. **Fussiness After Feeding**\n- Babies can be fussy for many reasons, not just hunger. Gas, growth spurts, overstimulation, or needing comfort can all play a role.\n- If your baby is having plenty of wet diapers (at least 6 per day after the first week), gaining weight, and seems alert during some parts of the day, these are reassuring signs that they\u2019re getting enough milk.\n\n### 2. **Milk Supply Concerns**\n- Pumping output is *not* a reliable indicator of your milk supply. Babies are usually more efficient at extracting milk than a pump.\n- If you\u2019re worried about supply, you can try:\n  - Nursing more frequently (even if it\u2019s just for comfort)\n  - Ensuring a good latch\n  - Offering both breasts at each feeding\n  - Skin-to-skin contact\n\n### 3. **Your Well-being**\n- Your exhaustion is important. Breastfeeding can be demanding, especially if you\u2019re not getting enough rest or support.\n- It\u2019s okay to supplement with formula if you need a break, or even switch entirely if that\u2019s what\u2019s best for you and your baby. Your mental and physical health matter, too.\n\n### 4. **Combination Feeding**\n- Many families find a middle ground by combining breastfeeding and formula. This can help relieve some pressure and allow others to help with feedings.\n\n### 5. **When to Seek Help**\n- If your baby isn\u2019t gaining weight, has fewer than 6 wet diapers a day, seems lethargic, or you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed or depressed, reach out to your pediatrician or a lactation consultant for more personalized support.\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:**  \nThere\u2019s no single \u201cright\u201d answer\u2014what\u2019s best is what works for both you and your baby.

Unfortunately, **there isn\u2019t a guaranteed, instant fix for colic** or persistent crying in newborns. Colic is common and usually resolves on its own by 3\u20134 months of age, but it can feel overwhelming while it\u2019s happening.\n\n**What you can try right now:**\n- **Check the basics:** Make sure your baby isn\u2019t hungry, needs a diaper change, or is too hot/cold.\n- **Soothing techniques:** Some babies respond to gentle rocking, swaddling, white noise, a pacifier, or a warm bath.\n- **Burping:** Sometimes trapped gas can cause discomfort\u2014try burping your baby after feeds.\n- **Motion:** Walking with your baby in your arms or in a stroller, or using a baby swing, can sometimes help.\n- **Skin-to-skin contact:** Holding your baby close can be calming for both of you.\n\n**Important:**  \nIf your baby has a fever, is vomiting, has diarrhea, isn\u2019t feeding well, seems lethargic, or you just feel something isn\u2019t right, **call your pediatrician or seek medical care right away**.\n\n**For you:**  \nIt\u2019s okay to put your baby safely in their crib for a few minutes and take a break if you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed. Your well-being matters, too. If you have a partner, friend, or family member who can help\u2014even for a short time\u2014let them.\n\n**You\u2019re not alone.** Many parents go through this, and it\u2019s not a reflection of your abilities or love for your baby. If you\u2019re feeling at your breaking point, please reach out to your healthcare provider for support\u2014for both your baby and yourself.\n\nWould you like more specific tips for soothing, or help figuring out when to see a doctor?",
