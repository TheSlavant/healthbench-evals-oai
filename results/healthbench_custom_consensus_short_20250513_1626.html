    <pre>Sedating a 2-year-old for MRI involves two quite different drugs and two very different practice models.

1. Chloral hydrate  
   • Historically the “work-horse” oral sedative for infants and toddlers.  
   • Produces moderate (sometimes deep) sedation but not general anesthesia.  
   • Can be administered by non-anesthesiology personnel if they meet AAP/ASA training, monitoring and rescue requirements for deep sedation.  
   • Success rates fall sharply after ~24 months of age (≈50–60 % failure at 2–3 yr).  
   • Drug has no reversal agent, and the U.S. FDA-approved product was discontinued (only compounded product now).  
   • Prolonged and sometimes biphasic recovery (4–8 h or more).

2. Propofol  
   • Ultra-short-acting IV anesthetic that quickly produces deep sedation or general anesthesia.  
   • Requires an anesthesia professional (or a credentialed “Sedation Service” with full credentialing for airway rescue) per ASA and most hospital policies.  
   • Very high success rates for MRI (&gt;95 %), rapid recovery (30–45 min).  
   • Titrable; can be used as single bolus or infusion.

AAP AND ASA GUIDELINES

AAP  
“Guidelines for Monitoring and Management of Pediatric Patients Before, During, and After Sedation for Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures” (last full revision 2016, reaffirmed 2023).  
• Provides specific dosing tables for many agents, including chloral hydrate and propofol.  
• Emphasizes that any time deep sedation might occur, the provider must be able to rescue a child from general anesthesia.

ASA  
“Practice Guidelines for Moderate Procedural Sedation and Analgesia 2018” (endorsed by ASA, ACEP, ASDA, etc.).  
• Does NOT list individual drug doses.  
• Stipulates that agents such as propofol—likely to cause deep sedation or general anesthesia—should be given only by individuals trained to manage the general-anesthetic state.

DOSE RANGES (from AAP 2016 table and common pediatric anesthesia texts)

Chloral hydrate  
• Initial: 50–75 mg / kg PO or PR (range 25–100 mg / kg cited).  
• May repeat 25–50 mg / kg once after 30–60 min if inadequate, but  
  – do not exceed 100 mg / kg total dose OR 2 g whichever is lower.  
• Onset 20–60 min; duration 60–120 min (can be longer).

Propofol (for MRI sedation by anesthesia provider)  
• Bolus: 1–2 mg / kg IV to induce.  
• Maintenance: 75–150 µg / kg / min (≈4.5–9 mg / kg / h).  
• Supplemental bolus 0.5–1 mg / kg as needed.  
(Exact regimen is tailored; some anesthesiologists prefer a 2–3 mg / kg bolus followed by 100–200 µg / kg / min for the first few minutes, then taper.)

WHICH TO CHOOSE FOR A 2-YEAR-OLD?

• If the institution has an anesthesia team readily available, propofol (or volatile GA) has become the de-facto standard for MRI at this age because of reliability and fast throughput.  
• If anesthesia coverage is not available and a qualified pediatric sedation team is performing the case, chloral hydrate remains an option, but parents should be counseled about the higher failure and longer recovery rates.  
• Alternative non-airway-depressing agents (e.g., dexmedetomidine, intranasal/IV) are increasingly used where available.

BOTTOM LINE

• AAP provides explicit dose ranges for chloral hydrate (50–75 mg / kg PO; max 100 mg / kg or 2 g) and propofol (1–2 mg / kg IV bolus; 75–150 µg / kg / min infusion) in its 2016 sedation guideline.  
• ASA’s 2018 sedation guideline gives no specific dosages, but mandates that propofol be administered only by practitioners qualified to rescue from general anesthesia.  
• For a typical 2-year-old undergoing MRI, propofol delivered by an anesthesia professional is now the most commonly recommended practice for predictable, efficient, and safe imaging, whereas chloral hydrate may be considered when anesthesia support is not available and the sedation team is properly credentialed.</pre>
